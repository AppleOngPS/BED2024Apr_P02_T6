# BED-Assignment: AMA Health HUB

Desription of the website

# Design Process

This website is focusing on anyone who are interested and want to find out more about healthy lifestyle through the website.As a user, I want the website to be easy to navigate to every page using the menu bar,providing distinct and clear category like Home, Recipe, Quiz, Meal planning ,Community, Credit, Reward, Login. As a reader ,readability will be a important factor,having a clear font,and contrasting colors to enhance the overall user experience.

We used Figma software to create the wireframe.Below is the attacked link for both desktop view and mobile view.
