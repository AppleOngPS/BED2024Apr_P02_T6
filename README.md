# BED-Assignment: AMA Health HUB

For our assignment we focused on creating a social impact through promoting healthy eating. The reason we created this website is to promote a healthy lifestyle and make it easier for people to access reliable information and resources. We believe that by providing a platform where users can learn, share, and support each other, we can encourage positive changes in dietary habits and overall well-being. Our goal is to empower individuals to take charge of their health and make informed decisions about their diet and lifestyle.

As a health and fitness-centred website, the application includes multiple elements like user registration, meal planning, user data, recipes, quizzes, community, rewards, and profile. The project will be implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as the key tools of the implementation process. The entire website is going to be in a green theme as it best represents healthy living. The website we tried to make it as minimalist as possible so that it is easy for users to use.

# Design Process

This website is focusing on anyone who are interested and want to find out more about healthy lifestyle through the website.As a user, I want the website to be easy to navigate to every page using the menu bar,providing distinct and clear category like Home, Recipe, Quiz, Meal planning ,Community, Credit, Reward, Login. As a reader ,readability will be a important factor,having a clear font,and contrasting colors to enhance the overall user experience.

We used Figma software to create the wireframe.Below is the attacked link for both desktop view and mobile view.
